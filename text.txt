R provides a powerful and comprehensive system for analysing data and when used in conjunction with the R-commander (a graphical user interface, commonly known as Rcmdr) it also provides one that is easy and intuitive to use. Basically, R provides the engine that carries out the analyses and Rcmdr provides a convenient way for users to input commands. The Rcmdr program enables analysts to access a selection of commonly-used R commands using a simple interface that should be familiar to most computer users. It also serves the important role of helping users to implement R commands and develop their knowledge and expertise in using the command line --- an important skill for those wishing to exploit the full power of the program.



Information about installing R can be found on the web at the R homepage http://www.r-project.org/ which provides lots of information about the R project and also directs users to one of the CRAN sites (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) that have been set up on many servers across the world in order for users to download the software. CRAN provides all files necessary to install R on a number of different computing platforms (Linux, MacOS X and Windows) along with detailed information about installation and also offers manuals and contributed documentation in a number of langauges and for a number of specific disciplines.
